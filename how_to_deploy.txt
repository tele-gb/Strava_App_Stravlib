1 - Create a VM Instance on GCE
1a - create a firewall rule that looks something like this (port 8080) - can create in console as well

You don't need to change port on which your app is exposed to the Internet - if you're OK with 8088 then use it.
Just make sure that you create a GCP firewall rule to let the traffic in. By default HTTP server and HTTPS server open ports 80 and 443 respectively. Port 8088 is blocked by default.
Example firewall rule to open up port 8080 for an instance with "tag1" tag from all IP's:

gcloud compute --project=myproject firewall-rules create port8088 
--direction=INGRESS 
--priority=1000 
--network=default 
--action=ALLOW 
--rules=tcp:8088 
--source-ranges=0.0.0.0/0 
--target-tags=tag1 ## tag can be something different likt the http server

Also - assign "tag1" tag to the VM you want to "unblock".


2 - Create SSH Keys on the VM
    ssh-keygen
3 - Navigate to SSH directory
    cd .ssh
4 - access and copy the public key
    cat id_rsa.pub
5 - This Public ssh needs to be added to Github ssh keys in order to clone repositores
6 - Once done this copy the ssh repotiory url - this will be used to clone
7 - git clone git@github.com:tele-gb/Web_cacl_app.git
8 - Install venv
    python3 -m venv venv
9 - Activate the venv (from the app directory you have just cloned)
    source venv/bin/activate
10 - install pip and requirments
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
11 - run the gunicorn command to start the app (this is specific for port 8080)
    gunicorn basic_flask:app -b 0.0.0.0:8080

12 - you can access the app @ http://34.28.40.253:8080
